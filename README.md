# Maze_solver
## Generate and solve any size maze.
- This uses a DFS algorithm to draw a fully traversible maze, meaning all points on the map will be able to connect via some path.
- The solving is done by BFS, meaning it is very fast, and finds the shortest path.
- It is able to generate and solve mazes of thousands of units in size.
- UI is straight forward, generate a maze of your selected size, choose target nodes, or generate random ones, and slick solve!
